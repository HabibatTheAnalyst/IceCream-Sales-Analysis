# IceCream Sales Analysis

Anyone who is sugar tolerant wants the cold-sweet feel of ice cream. How it melts, flavor bursts in the mouth, and the cool feeling it gives during hot weather. Amidst this freshness, seasonality often has full control of how individuals demand or crave Ice cream. We will see this further in this post.

> ### The aim of this project was to determine statistically if temperature affects IceCream sales.

### Technology
* GoogleSheet
* Python
* Statistical measures
#### steps
GoogleSheet was used to clean and wrangle the dataset. The clean dataset was then uploaded to jupyter notebook through command prompt. The data was loaded and statistical measures such as P-value and correlation were applied to derive at an hypothesis.
