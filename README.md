# IceCream Sales Analysis

Anyone who is sugar tolerant wants the cold-sweet feel of ice cream. How it melts, flavor bursts in the mouth, and the cool feeling it gives during hot weather. Amidst this freshness, seasonality often has full control of how individuals demand or crave Ice cream.

### Hypothesis 
Increase in temperature affects IceCream sales and vice versa

> ### The aim of this project was to determine statistically if temperature affects IceCream sales.

### Description
The project focused on IceCream sales. The dataset has two variables(temperature and revenue) with 500 rows. The aim was to determine statistically if temperature changes affects demands for IceCream as well as revenue. And since correlation and causation are often mixed up because humans like to find patterns even when they do not exist, I took extra precautions to visualize the correlation. Because correlation charts that show causation can be effective.

### Technology
* GoogleSheet
* Python
* Statistical measures
#### steps
GoogleSheet was used to clean and wrangle the dataset. The clean dataset was then uploaded to jupyter notebook through command prompt. The data was loaded and statistical measures such as P-value and correlation were applied to derive at an hypothesis.
